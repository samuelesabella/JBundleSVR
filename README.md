# JBundleSVR
This work addresses support vector regression with Bundle Method
convex optimization implemented using Julia programming language. We
have tested different master problem stabilization techniques to overcome
the main flaws of a naÄ±ve implementation and tested our bundle method
implementation on a quadratic maximum problem to verify the correctness of our solver. The report file is available at: [report](CM.pdf).

# Experiments
A jupyter notebook is available with few experiments ready

# Dataset
